# Card-Game
This is a card game that I am making in order to learn javascript, html, and css

Most of this was done during my Spring Break 2023

I don't know how to use this other than to download all 3 into a file and use live server with VS Code
So if you want to use it that is the only way I know how lol.

Enjoy :)
